This sofware is currently in alpha.

Hadaly is a presentation software allowing to manipulate slides, in various ways during presentation. The goal is to offer a practical presentation software for art historians or any other individual who wants to have a bit more interaction with their presentations.

It contains a presentation editor and a viewer. The editor allows you to build presentations by creating slides from pictures and by adding information about them (e.g: artist, title and year). And, well, the viewer allows you to show and manipulate the slides.

Presentations are saved as `*.opah` files which contains all the slides image files and their metadata (JSON format).
